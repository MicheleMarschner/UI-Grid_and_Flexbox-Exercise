# Exercise Wireframe, Flexbox and Grid

## Instructions

 1. Open the desktop pictures in the design folder. Use pen and paper or some wireframing online tool to draw rough wireframings of the elements (it should look  similar to the grid area template we programmed today) 
 
 2. Build your wireframes with the help of CSS Grid and Flexbox. You can neglect all content for now. Just use placeholders for all the important elements 
 
 3. Begin with the rough website layout to the more detailed, inner elements. So start with the overall layout, then look at the larger elements in a single section and in the end at the inner elements of each section.

 4. Later on you can try to fill the elements with content and rebuild the whole website as shown in the pictures

 5. There is a mobile version too. After you learned media queries feel free to rebuild the mobile website too so you can add it to your portfolio
